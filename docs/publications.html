    <p style="font-size: 20px"><b>Julian Landaw</b>, Xiaoping Yuan, Peng-Sheng Chen, and Zhilin Qu<br>American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology 320 (2) H826-H837, 2021</p>
    <p>Abstract:<br>Spiral wave reentry as a mechanism of lethal ventricular arrhythmias has been widely demonstrated in animal experiments and recordings from human hearts. It has been shown that in structurally normal hearts spiral waves are unstable, breaking up into multiple wavelets via dynamical instabilities. However, many of the second-generation action potential models give rise only to stable spiral waves, raising issues regarding the underlying mechanisms of spiral wave breakup. In this study, we carried out computer simulations of two-dimensional homogeneous tissues using five ventricular action potential models. We show that the transient outward potassium current (<i>I</i><sub>to</sub>), although it is not required, plays a key role in promoting spiral wave breakup in all five models. As the maximum conductance of <i>I</i><sub>to</sub> increases, it first promotes spiral wave breakup and then stabilizes the spiral waves. In the absence of <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>, speeding up the L-type calcium kinetics can prevent spiral wave breakup, however, with the same speedup kinetics, spiral wave breakup can be promoted by increasing <i>I</i><sub>to</sub>. Increasing <i>I</i><sub>to</sub> promotes single-cell dynamical instabilities, including action potential duration alternans and chaos, and increasing <i>I</i><sub>to</sub> further suppresses these action potential dynamics. These cellular properties agree with the observation that increasing <i>I</i><sub>to</sub> first promotes spiral wave breakup and then stabilizes spiral waves in tissue. Implications of our observations to spiral wave dynamics in the real hearts and action potential model improvements are discussed.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px"><b>Julian Landaw</b>, Zhaoyang Zhang, Zhen Song, Michael B. Liu, Riccardo Olcese, Peng-Sheng Chen, James N. Weiss, and Zhilin Qu<br>Heart Rhythm 17 (9), 1582-1590, 2020</p>
    <p>BACKGROUND Small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated potassium (SK) channels play complex roles in cardiac arrhythmogenesis. SK channels colocalize with L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, yet how this colocalization affects cardiac arrhythmogenesis is unknown.
<br><br>OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of colocalization of SK channels with L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in promoting J-wave syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias.
<br><br>METHODS We carried out computer simulations of single-cell and tissue models. SK channels in the model were assigned to preferentially sense Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the bulk cytosol, subsarcolemmal space, or junctional cleft.
<br><br>RESULTS When SK channels sense Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the bulk cytosol, the SK current (<i>I</i><sub>SK</sub>) rises and decays slowly during an action potential, the action potential duration (APD) decreases as the maximum conductance increases, no complex APD dynamics and phase 2 reentry can be induced by <i>I</i><sub>SK</sub>. When SK channels sense Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the subsarcolemmal space or junctional cleft, <i>I</i><sub>SK</sub> can rise and decay rapidly during an action potential in a spike-like pattern because of spiky Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in these compartments, which can cause spike-and-dome action potential morphology, APD alternans, J-wave elevation, and phase 2 reentry. Our results can account for the experimental finding that activation of <i>I</i><sub>SK</sub> induced J-wave syndrome and phase 2 reentry in rabbit hearts.
<br><br>CONCLUSION Colocalization of SK channels with L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels so that they preferentially sense Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the subsarcolemmal or junctional space may result in a spiky <i>I</i><sub>SK</sub>, which can functionally play a similar role of the transient outward K1 current in promoting J-wave syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px">Chunli Huang, Zhen Song, <b>Julian Landaw</b>, and Zhilin Qu<br>Biophysical Journal 118 (10), 2574-2587, 2020</p>
    <p>Abstract:<br>Spatially discordant alternans (SDA) of action potential duration (APD) has been widely observed in cardiac tissue and is linked to cardiac arrhythmogenesis. Theoretical studies have shown that conduction velocity restitution (CVR) is required for the formation of SDA. However, this theory is not completely supported by experiments, indicating that other mechanisms may exist. In this study, we carried out computer simulations using mathematical models of action potentials to investigate the mechanisms of SDA in cardiac tissue. We show that when CVR is present and engaged, such as fast pacing from one side of the tissue, the spatial pattern of APD in the tissue undergoes either spatially concordant alternans or SDA, independent of initial conditions or tissue heterogeneities. When CVR is not engaged, such as simultaneous pacing of the whole tissue or under normal/slow heart rates, the spatial pattern of APD in the tissue can have multiple solutions, including spatially concordant alternans and different SDA patterns, depending on heterogeneous initial conditions or pre-existing repolarization heterogeneities. In homogeneous tissue, curved nodal lines are not stable, which either evolve into straight lines or disappear. However, in heterogeneous itssue, curved nodal lines can be stable, depending on their initial locations and shapes relative to the structure of the heterogeneity. Therefore, CVR-induced SDA and non-CVR-induced SDA exhibit different dynamical properties, which may be responsible for the different SDA properties observed in experimental studies and arrhythmogenesis in different clinical settings.</p>

    <p>Abstract:<br>We develop an iterated map model to describe the bifurcations and complex dynamics caused by the feedback between voltage and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations in paced ventricular myocytes. Voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> can form either a positive or a negative feedback loop, while voltage and Na<sup>+</sup> form a negative feedback loop. Under certain diseased conditions, when the feedback between voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> is positive, Hopf bifurcations occur, leading to periodic oscillatory behaviors. When this feedback is negative, period-doubling bifurcation routes to alternans and chaos occur.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px"><b>Julian Landaw</b> and Zhilin Qu<br>Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science 28 (11), 2018 </p>
    <p>Abstract:<br>Sudden cardiac death is known to be associated with dynamical instabilities in the heart, and thus control of dynamical instabilities is considered a potential therapeutic strategy. Different control methods were developed previously, including time-delayed feedback pacing control and constant diastolic interval pacing control. Experimental, theoretical, and simulation studies have examined the efficacy of these control methods in stabilizing action potential dynamics. In this study, we apply these control methods to control complex action potential (AP) dynamics under two diseased conditions: early repolarization syndrome and long QT syndrome, in which voltage-driven instabilities occur in the presence of short-term cardiac memory. In addition, we also develop a feedback pacing method to stabilize these instabilities. We perform theoretical analyses using iterated map models and carry out numerical simulations of AP models. We show that under the normal condition where the memory effect is minimal, all three methods can effectively control the action potential duration (APD) dynamics. Under the two diseased conditions where the memory effect is exacerbated, constant diastolic pacing control is least effective, while the feedback pacing control is most effective. Under a very strong memory effect, all three methods fail to stabilize the voltage-driven instabilities. The failure of effective control is due to memory and the all-or-none AP dynamics which results in very steep changes in APD.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px"><b>Julian Landaw</b> and Zhilin Qu<br>Physical Review E 97 (4), 042414, 2018</p>
    <p>Abstract:<br>Excitable cells, such as cardiac myocytes, exhibit short-term memory, i.e., the state of the cell depends on its history of excitation. Memory can originate from slow recovery of membrane ion channels or from accumulation of intracellular ion concentrations, such as calcium ion or sodium ion concentration accumulation. Here we examine the effects of memory on excitation dynamics in cardiac myocytes under two diseased conditions, early repolarization and reduced repolarization reserve, each with memory from two different sources: slow recovery of a potassium ion channel and slow accumulation of the intracellular calcium ion concentration. We first carry out computer simulations of action potential models described by differential equations to demonstrate complex excitation dynamics, such as chaos. We then develop iterated map models that incorporate memory, which accurately capture the complex excitation dynamics and bifurcations of the action potential models. Finally, we carry out theoretical analyses of the iteratedmap models to reveal the underlying mechanisms of memory-induced nonlinear dynamics. Our study demonstrates that the memory effect can be unmasked or greatly exacerbated under certain diseased conditions, which promotes complex excitation dynamics, such as chaos. The iterated map models reveal that memory converts a monotonic iterated map function into a nonmonotonic one to promote the bifurcations leading to high periodicity and chaos.</p>

Here we use computer simulation of cardiac action potential models to demonstrate that memory can cause dynamical instabilities that result in complex excitation dynamics and chaos.

    <p style="font-size: 20px"><b>Julian William Landaw</b><br>2019</p>
    <p>Abstract:<br>Dynamical instabilities in the heart promote arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD), one of the most common causes of death in individuals with cardiovascular disease. Beat-to-beat changes in electrophysiological properties at the cellular level can promote arrhythmogenesis at the whole-heart level, yet the precise mechanisms are not well understood. 
<br><br>Cardiac cells possess memory, whereby certain physiological properties depend on the prior history. Here, we analyze the effects of short-term cardiac memory from two sources: the slow recovery of ion channels and the slow accumulation of ion concentrations over time. We demonstrate that under diseased conditions, namely early repolarization syndrome and long QT syndrome, action potentials become unstable during fixed pacing due to enhanced effects of memory on action potential duration. We develop new iterated map models that explicitly incorporates the effects of memory on action potential duration, and show that the dynamics of the iterated map models match very closely to the dynamics of detailed action potential models. Using the iterated map models, we propose new techniques of controlling action potential instability under the influence of memory and confirm their efficacy in the detailed action potential models.
<br><br>Finally, we show that action potential instability at the cellular level can generate arrhythmias at tissue-scale levels. In a model of early repolarization syndrome driven by activation of small-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> (SK) channels, action potential instability promotes phase 2 reentry. Spiral wave dynamics become unstable due to early repolarization driven by the transient outward K<sup>+</sup> current (<i>I</i><sub>to</sub>), suggesting that action potential instability induced by memory is a mechanism of arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px">Tomas Radivoyevitch, Lynn Hlatky, <b>Julian Landaw</b>, and Rainer K. Sachs<br>Blood, The Journal of the American Society of Hematology 119 (19), 4363-4371, 2012</p>
    <p>Abstract:<br>Mathematical models of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell population dynamics are being developed to improve CML understanding and treatment. We review such models in light of relevant findings from radiobiology, emphasizing 3 points. First, the CML models almost all assert that the latency time, from CML initiation to diagnosis, is at most 10 years. Meanwhile, current radiobiologic estimates, based on Japanese atomic bomb survivor data, indicate a substantially higher maximum, suggesting longer-term relapses and extra resistance mutations. Second, different CML models assume different numbers, between 400 and 106, of normal HSCs. Radiobiologic estimates favor values > 106 for the number of normal cells (often assumed to be the HSCs) that are at risk for a CML-initiating BCR-ABL translocation. Moreover, there is some evidence for an HSC dead-band hypothesis, consistent with HSC numbers being very different across different healthy adults. Third, radiobiologists have found that sporadic (background, agedriven) chromosome translocation incidence increases with age during adulthood. BCR-ABL translocation incidence increasing with age would provide a hitherto underanalyzed contribution to observed background adult-onset CML incidence acceleration with age, and would cast some doubt on stage-number inferences from multistage carcinogenesis models in general.</p>
